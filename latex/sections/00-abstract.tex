Agentic systems for drug discovery can plan syntheses, mine literature, and design molecules, but how well do they generalize beyond small-molecule workflows? We evaluate six frameworks against 15 task classes spanning peptide therapeutics, in vivo pharmacology, and resource-constrained settings. The result: five critical capability gaps. Current frameworks cannot handle protein language models or peptide-specific prediction, lack bridges between in vivo and in silico data, support only LLM inference rather than ML training or reinforcement learning, assume large-pharma resources, and optimize single objectives while ignoring safety-efficacy-stability trade-offs. A knowledge-probing experiment across four frontier LLMs shows that peptide expertise already exists in foundation models (aggregate gap $= -0.115$, all $p > 0.05$) but remains stranded behind small-molecule-only architectures. We derive design requirements and a capability matrix to guide next-generation frameworks toward computational partners that augment practitioner judgment under realistic constraints.
