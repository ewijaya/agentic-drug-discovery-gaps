If the para-methyl analog has IC50 = 200 nM, what is the most likely potency change when replacing para-CH3 with para-Cl, and what is the mechanistic rationale?",
    "reference_answer": "Replacing para-CH3 with para-Cl is most likely to improve potency (often ~2–10×) because Cl increases hydrophobic contact and can form a favorable halogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen at ~3.0–3.5 Å.

    "reference_answer": "TI = 25/5 = 5. A TI of ~5 is concerning because the therapeutic window against bacteria is narrow relative to red blood cell toxicity, increasing the risk of hemolytic side effects. Reducing hydrophobic moment or overall hydrophobicity, or tuning charge distribution to decrease nonspecific membrane disruption, is a common direction to reduce hemolysis while maintaining antimicrobial activity.",

    "reference_answer": "None meets both criteria: A meets potency but fails solubility (2 µM), B meets solubility but fails potency (80 nM), and C is potent but has very poor solubility (0.5 µM). The logical next step is to design around A (closest to meeting both) with a solubilizing modification that minimally perturbs the potency-driving motif, and to confirm solubility-limited assay artifacts are not inflating potency estimates for C. This triage uses explicit go/no-go thresholds rather than subjective ranking.",

    "reference_answer": "None meets both criteria: A meets potency but fails stability (15 min), B meets stability but fails potency (80 nM), and C is potent but extremely unstable (5 min). The logical next step is to optimize around A by introducing stability-enhancing modifications (e.g., cyclization or targeted D/N-methyl substitutions at cleavage sites) while monitoring potency preservation.

EC50 should be interpreted as the concentration producing 50% of its own maximal effect (i.e., 30% of the full-agonist maximum in this comparison), not 50% of the full agonist’s Emax.

Measuring tissue concentrations at the infection site (or target occupancy/biomarkers in the tissue) can confirm whether the limitation is distribution/penetration rather than systemic exposure.

    "reference_answer": "Counterclockwise hysteresis implies a delay between plasma concentration and effect, commonly due to distributional delay to the effect site, slow receptor binding, or indirect response mechanisms. Improving identifiability requires denser early timepoint sampling and measurements near the onset of effect to characterize the delay, plus extended sampling to capture equilibration.
