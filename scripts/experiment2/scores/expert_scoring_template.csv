qwen3-next:80b-cloud|GEN-SM-05,1,Identifies a real risk that a generator can game a QSAR by exploiting spurious correlations under strong guidance, but misframes the primary failure mode as valence or SMILES invalidity rather than the more common valid-but–out-of-distribution or unrealistic reward-hacking behavior; the proposed detection method based on RDKit validity or parseability is therefore only a partial proxy and will miss the central issue where molecules remain chemically valid yet pathological while scoring well under a biased predictor; the answer also in
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|SAR-PEP-08,2,Fold-change math is correct: \u0394\u0394G \u2248 1.0 kcal/mol at 298 K corresponds to ~5.4× affinity improvement.
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|SAR-PEP-08,3,Correct mechanism-level explanation: stapling increases helical preorganization and lowers the conformational entropy penalty upon binding from a mostly disordered state.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|GEN-PEP-10,1,Captures some core needs (expanded residue/topology definitions; force-field/charge/dihedral/rotamer/solvation parameterization for nnAAs) but mixes in many confident, likely-hallucinated numeric specifics and exaggerated error claims.
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|GEN-PEP-05,2,Correctly identifies “model hacking”/artifact exploitation as the key failure mode for generator optimization against a fixed predictor
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|OPT-PEP-01,1,Definition is essentially correct: single-position Ala substitutions to map SAR/hotspots.Overstates interpretation: big loss can reflect direct target contacts or indirect structural/solubility/stability effects; answer frames it mostly as direct interactions.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|GEN-SM-02,2,Correct core explanation: graph generation can enforce/localize chemical constraints (valence/bonding) during decoding, while naive character-level SMILES must learn brittle syntax and long-range dependencies (rings/branches), causing many invalid strings.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ADMET-PEP-07,2,Correct computation of extraction ratio,Overconfident mechanistic add-ons.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ASSAY-SM-05,2,Correctly interprets the IC50 left-shift with longer preincubation as time-dependent inhibition, consistent with slow-tight binding and/or covalent inhibition.Appropriate follow-up: a (jump-)dilution / activity-recovery assay to test reversibility (persistent inhibition after large dilution supports irreversible/covalent; recovery supports reversible/slow-tight).Minor limitations: recovery thresholds like “>80%” are arbitrary, and slow off-rate inhibitors can look “irreversible” over short observation windows unless you monitor recovery over time (or add orthogonal confirmation such as dialysis/washout or adduct MS).
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ASSAY-PEP-10,2,Interpretation is correct under common HTS convention: Z′ between 0.5 and 1.0 is considered excellent assay separation/quality.  Minor nuance missing: “>0.5” is a widely used rule-of-thumb rather than a universal gate, but this doesn’t make the answer wrong.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|OPT-PEP-09,2,Correct multiplicative prediction. The added binding-energy estimate is wrong.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|OPT-SM-09,1,Correctly computes the multiplicative prediction. Answer is truncated/incomplete, so overall only partially answers the question.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ASSAY-PEP-04,3,Half-life calculation is correct. Correct, relevant caveat about pseudo-first-order conditions and what that implies about the kinetic assumption.
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ASSAY-PEP-06,2,TI calculation is correct. Design direction is reasonable (tuning membrane selectivity via reduced hydrophobicity / altered cationicity), though a bit oversimplified without noting trade-offs or amphipathicity/hydrophobic moment nuance.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|SAR-PEP-01,1,Directionally plausible that Leu→Phe could improve affinity by enabling an edge-to-face aryl–aryl contact if the pocket tolerates the larger aromatic and the geometry is realized, but “most likely” is still too strong given missing structural/solvation constraints.The quantitative affinity claim (5–50×) and specific kcal/mol attributions are overconfident/unsupported; even the canonical edge-to-face benzene dimer interaction energy (~2.31 kcal/mol in high-level calculations) does not directly map to net protein–ligand ΔΔG in water.The ΔG↔Kd conversion intuition is fine (a 10× affinity change corresponds to ~1.4 kcal/mol at 25 °C), but the answer extrapolates this into a specific fold-change without enough evidence.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|SAR-PEP-05,2,Correct core expectation, Reasonable secondary benefit. Overconfident specifics: the “steric clash at 2.9 Å” and “10–1000×” potency loss are highly context/geometry-dependent (and the 2.9 Å figure is usually an H-bond metric, not a guaranteed methyl–protein clash distance)
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ADMET-SM-05,2,Correct use of the well-stirred model form and the “high extraction” limit, Minor caveat missing: if reducing fᵤ makes fᵤ·CL_int no longer ≫ Q_h, clearance would start decreasing proportionally; the answer assumes the high-extraction condition still holds after the change.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ASSAY-SM-04,2,Correct use of Cheng–Prusoff for a competitive inhibitor. Minor nuance not addressed: Cheng–Prusoff relies onstandard assumptions (simple reversible competition.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|ASSAY-SM-07,2, Lacks some practical specificity/nuance (e.g., confirmatory repeat assays; pH–solubility/pKa/logD profiling to choose between salt vs structural fixes), and the response is truncated mid-action.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|SAR-SM-01,1,Correct qualitative direction: para-Cl can engage a directional σ-hole halogen bond to a backbone carbonyl at ~3.2 Å, which can plausibly increase affinity vs para-Me.Quantitative potency/ΔG mapping is not reliable: even small energetic changes correspond to modest fold-changes (e.g., ~0.4 kcal/mol ≈ 2-fold), so “0.5–1.5 kcal = 4–13×” and the asserted 5–20× gain look overconfident.Several supporting specifics (hydrophobic π values, “size match” radii comparisons, desolvation claims) are dubious/unsupported, so while the mechanism is plausible, the numeric prediction is not trustworthy.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|GEN-PEP-02,1,Correct core idea: MLM trains a pLM to predict masked amino acids from surrounding context, which is exactly what makes “inpainting” (mask variable positions while keeping a motif fixed) straightforward. Several claims are overstated or shaky (e.g., “maximizes stability,” explicit UniRef sequence-count specifics); these read as confident but not well-supported. The answer is incomplete/truncated at the end (“hallucinate or in…”), leaving part of the explanation unfinished.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|OPT-SM-04,2,Correctly states EI prefers candidates with high posterior mean and/or high posterior uncertainty (exploration–exploitation trade-off), Minor nuance missing: EI can still be driven by uncertainty even when μ(x) is below the incumbent (it’s not strictly “only when competitive”), and the numeric potency example is illustrative rather than demonstrated.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|ASSAY-PEP-09,2,Kinetic explanation (two peptide subpopulations with different effective k_obs due to conformation/aggregation or site accessibility) is scientifically plausible and matches biphasic loss behavior. The proposed test is directionally good (probing structural heterogeneity; denaturant collapsing the slow phase is a clean discriminator), though CD during a proteolysis time course can be confounded by fragments or mixed species and may be difficult for short peptides. It misses other common kinetic causes of biphasic decay (e.g., protease inactivation or autolysis, product inhibition, or protease saturation effects) and a simple rate-scaling test (varying protease concentration) that would more directly validate a two-rate model.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|ADMET-PEP-10,2,Gets the core mechanism right: 1–5 kDa peptides are far below the effective glomerular size cutoff and are therefore freely filtered, so renal filtration drives rapid systemic clearance. PEGylation rationale is broadly correct (increasing hydrodynamic size reduces glomerular filtration), but some numeric/wording details are oversimplified (e.g., “steric hindrance” framing and specific nm thresholds). Tubular handling is described a bit loosely: filtered peptides are typically taken up in the proximal tubule and degraded rather than “not reabsorbed,” and key mechanisms (e.g.,
kimi-k2.5:cloud|ASSAY-PEP-04,2,Half-life and remaining fraction are computed correctly: t₁/₂ ≈ 30.1 min and e^(−0.023·120) ≈ 0.063 (~6.3% remaining), i.e., ~4 half-lives in 2 hours; practical assay implications (major loss over 2 h; need early timepoints, quench, or inhibition) are relevant and scientifically sound; the “pharmacokinetic relevance” point is somewhat overgeneralized, since an in vitro pseudo-first-order protease degradation rate does not directly imply systemic clearance without additional context (matrix, protease identity and concentrat
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|SAR-SM-09,2,Correct: removing a mostly protonated tertiary amine that forms an Asp ion pair will most likely reduce potency due to loss of a key electrostatic or salt-bridge interaction; correct that an amide is effectively neutral at physiological pH and typically cannot replace a cationic contact, as it may hydrogen-bond but this is usually weaker than the lost ion pair in many binding sites; minor issue: the quoted kcal/mol “salt bridge vs H-bond” values are overspecific and highly context-dependent, since solvent exposure and desolvation can substantially
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|SAR-PEP-08,3,Fold-change is correct: using ΔG° = RT ln Kd, a ΔΔG = −1.0 kcal/mol at 298 K implies Kd decreases by exp(1/RT) ≈ 5.4× (often rounded to ~5-fold); the mechanism is correct and appropriately framed, as stapling preorganizes the peptide toward the bound α-helix and reduces the conformational entropy penalty upon binding (less unfavorable −TΔS); good nuance is included in noting possible additional enthalpic or interaction effects, since stapling can shift both entropy and enthalpy depending on context and chemistry.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ADMET-PEP-02,2,Correctly identifies two plausible stabilizing modifications at a Lys trypsin-like cleavage site (side-chain charge masking and D-residue substitution) with appropriate mechanism (loss of Lys/Arg recognition in the specificity pocket and protease stereospecificity); the timescale change is qualitatively right (minutes to hours or longer), but the specific numeric half-life ranges are overconfident and not generally typical across sequences or sera; minor conceptual slop remains (e.g., implying “trypsin-like enzymes” are abundant in serum in a literal trypsin sense, and some additional examples or claims are not tightly supported).
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|OPT-SM-06,2,Correct strategy: grow or append a hydrophobic group to occupy the target-only lipophilic pocket extension, which is a standard structure-based selectivity tactic for kinases; correct rationale: added favorable hydrophobic or van der Waals contacts in the target and poorer fit (steric clash or unsatisfied hydrophobe) in the off-target’s smaller pocket; not quite expert-level because it fails to flag practical caveats such as the risk of boosting off-target binding if the pocket is flexible, or ADME and solubility penal
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|SAR-SM-07,1,Gets the main direction right (adding a ring nitrogen can create a target-only hydrogen bond and thus improve selectivity), and the cited hydrogen-bond energy and logP magnitudes are broadly reasonable; however, it does not actually explain the off-target effect, since the off-target lacks the Ser OH and therefore likely pays a desolvation penalty or loses hydrophobic contact without compensation, reducing off-target potency and driving selectivity; it is also overconfident about “maintaining or slightly increasing potency” without key caveats, as 3-pyridyl geometry and orientation, protonation state, and loss of pure hydrophobic packing can also reduce on-target affinity if the hydrogen bond is not w
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|OPT-SM-04,2,Correctly states that EI favors points with high expected improvement over the current best and balances exploitation (high posterior mean) with exploration (high posterior uncertainty); correctly explains why uncertainty is needed, since EI is defined on the predictive distribution (mean and variance) and without uncertainty collapses to essentially greedy selection with no principled exploration; slightly hand-wavy in saying EI “explicitly weights” uncertainty, as the effect arises through the σ term in the expected improvement under the full posterior rather than from an arbitra
kimi-k2.5:cloud|ADMET-PEP-09,2,Correctly identifies two plausible causes of time-dependent (accelerating) clearance for peptides or biologics—ADA-driven clearance and target-mediated drug disposition driven by an expanding target pool after repeat dosing; provides appropriate discriminator measurements, including tiered ADA testing with neutralizing antibody characterization and optional immune-complex handling, which are standard for linking immunogenicity to PK changes; the TMDD section is directionally right (target saturation or occupancy, free versus total drug behavior, target levels), but some specifics are overgeneralized (e.g., ADA effects “worsen regardless of dose,” or FcRn considerations that do not apply to most peptides without Fc or albumin engineering), so it falls short of expert-level precision.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|ADMET-SM-03,2,The IC50 “flag” guidance (<10 µM as a trigger and <1 µM as a major concern) matches commonly used 10 µM inhibitor thresholds in practice and datasets; the physicochemical risk pattern (basic, lipophilic, aromatic) is directionally correct, but several specifics such as fixed pKa or clogP cutoffs and residue-level binding narratives are more assertive than required and not universally predictive; the exposure-margin discussion is relevant, but the quoted >30× margin is not a dominant consensus in later evaluations, where ~45–50× or higher margins are often reported, making th
kimi-k2.5:cloud|SAR-PEP-05,2,Correct primary effect: N-methylation removes the backbone N–H hydrogen-bond donor, so if that donor is critical for binding, activity is expected to drop strongly; correct secondary benefit: backbone N-methylation is a well-known strategy to improve proteolytic stability and can improve permeability in some contexts, often in a position- or pattern-dependent manner; however, the specific energetic (1–3 kcal/mol) and “10–100× Kd” claims are on
kimi-k2.5:cloud|ASSAY-SM-10,2,Z′ formula and arithmetic are correct: Z′ = 1 − 3(σp + σn)/|μp − μn| = 1 − 21/90 ≈ 0.767; the interpretation that ~0.77 reflects excellent or very good assay separation is consistent with common HTS Z′ guidance (excellent typically ≥0.5 and often around ≥0.7), with the minor nuance that such cutoffs are conventional and context-dependent rather than strict gates, which does not affect the correctness here.
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ASSAY-SM-07,1,Correct that no analog meets both IC50 ≤ 50 nM and solubility ≥ 5 µM; the proposed next step (optimizing B for potency) is plausible but ignores the equally logical and often more direct strategy of improving solubility for A or C, which already meet the potency cutoff; it also lacks explicit trade-off framing (which compound is closest to criteria and why) and does not suggest confirmatory or diagnostic experiments (e.g., repeat IC50 or solubility measurements, pH–solubility profiling, aggrega
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|SAR-PEP-04,2,Correct: a single L→D substitution within a right-handed α-helix typically disrupts local helical geometry and side-chain presentation, which is especially damaging for a buried, helix-dependent binding interface and will usually strongly reduce or abolish activity; the rationale is sound, involving backbone dihedral constraints, helix stability, and altered side-chain orientation at the interface; it lacks the nuance that D substitutions can sometimes be tolerated at helix termini or in special contexts that preserve helicity (or form an all-D left-handed helix), but given a buried interface the predicted direction remains correct.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|SAR-SM-10,2,Core recommendation is correct: increasing the rotational barrier via ortho steric bulk to access a configurationally stable, single active atropisomer or preorganized dihedral is a standard and generally valid potency or selectivity strategy for atroposelective binding; however, the quantitative claims are overconfident, as assumptions such as a 50/50 atropisomer population, “typically >25 kcal/mol” as a hard stability threshold, or potency doubling from isolating one isomer are not generally guaranteed and depend on the ΔG between atropisomers, the relationship between barrier height and thermodynamics, and binding kinetics; additionally, some example name-dropping is shaky or irrelevant and distracts from the central mechanistic design rationale.
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ADMET-SM-10,2,Correctly states the commonly cited human biliary-excretion molecular-weight threshold (≳500–600 Da) and the lower rat threshold (~325 Da), which is a standard species distinction; appropriately highlights biliary-favoring properties such as higher molecular weight, amphipathic or polar anionic character (often conjugated species), and reliance on hepatic efflux transporters (e.g., MRP2, BCRP, P-gp); the renal-versus-biliary contrast is mostly correct but somewhat simplified, since features like “permanent p
kimi-k2.5:cloud|ADMET-SM-03,2,Correctly identifies the common hERG-liability pattern as lipophilic and often basic or cationic with aromatic or hydrophobic features, aligning with descriptor trends (logP or lipophilicity, ionization or pKa, aromaticity) reported across hERG datasets; uses an IC50 < 10 µM blocker or flag cutoff that is widely applied in practice and literature (with <1 µM typically treated as higher concern and 1–10 µM as intermediate); however, several details are stated too specifically or universally (e.g., “typically pKa >7.5–8.0,” fluorinated phenyl rings, fixed Å-distance motifs such as a “hERG triangle,” or MW >400), whereas the literature emphasizes substantial variability, including contributions fr
kimi-k2.5:cloud|ADMET-PEP-02,1,D-Lys at the P1 position is a plausible stabilization tactic because trypsin is strongly stereospecific and typically cleaves C-terminal to L-Lys or L-Arg, with cleavage rules further modulated by local sequence context (e.g., Pro at P1′); however, “N-methylation of the Lys side-chain amine” is not a standard or reliable way to block trypsin-like cleavage, as modified Lys residues (including dimethylated Lys) can still be cleaved in practice and the claim that cleavage requires a positively charged primary amine is oversimplified or likely incorrect; additionally, the stated stability jump (minutes to
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|SAR-SM-02,2,Correct direction: masking a required carboxylate as a neutral methyl ester will typically markedly reduce binding or potency by abolishing the ionic component of a critical salt bridge to Lys (salt bridges are commonly ~2.7–3.2 Å); the point that ester analogs are often inactive unless used as prodrugs is well grounded and supported by examples where the free acid is required for binding; however, the specific 10× to >1000× potency-loss range is overconfident and not guaranteed, and steric clash is unlikely to be the primary driver compared with loss of charge and proper interact
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|OPT-SM-04,2,Correctly states that EI prefers candidates with high predicted mean and/or high predictive uncertainty, reflecting the exploration–exploitation trade-off; the uncertainty rationale is mostly right in that EI is an expectation under the posterior, but it omits the standard EI form ((μ − f*)Φ(z) + σϕ(z)) and slightly oversimplifies the zero-uncertainty case; the molecular-specific add-ons (rugged landscapes, activity cliffs, chemical space size) are plausible but not required to answe*
kimi-k2.5:cloud|GEN-SM-07,2,Uses three widely applied post-hoc filters in generative small-molecule workflows (SAscore, QED, RAscore) and describes them in broadly correct terms, with a plausible example cutoff such as SAscore < 4.5 that is commonly used in practice; however, there is minor imprecision in that QED is a weighted composite of specific physicochemical descriptors rather than a notion of “saturation,” and acceptable thresholds are highly project-dependent, a nuance that is missing and k
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|OPT-SM-10,2,Correct Pareto set: none of the four compounds is dominated under the objectives (minimize IC50, minimize clearance, maximize solubility), so A, B, C, and D are all Pareto-optimal; the reasoning is incomplete because it only demonstrates non-domination for A and does not explicitly check B, C, and D, but the final conclusion is still correct; there are no major scientific or optimization errors in the definition of Pareto optimality (dominance requires being strictly better in all o
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|SAR-SM-07,2,Core rationale is correct: adding a pyridine nitrogen can create a new hydrogen-bond acceptor for a target Ser–OH, potentially increasing target affinity and selectivity versus a homolog lacking that donor; however, potency increases are not guaranteed, since burying a polar heteroatom in a hydrophobic poc
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|ADMET-PEP-06,2,Correct strategies include backbone amide N-methylation to reduce hydrogen-bond donors and desolvation penalties and sometimes enable chameleonic conformations that favor membrane traversal, and the charge-masking prodrug concept is valid in principle, as biolabile esterase-cleavable lipophilic promoieties can improve permeability by neutralizing or attenuating polar charge; however, the discussion is not quite expert-level because it glosses over the practical difficulty of reliably masking cationic Lys or Arg side chains (relative to simpler carboxylate esterification) and only lightly treats the strong position dependence and trade-offs associated with N-methylation.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ASSAY-PEP-02,2,Correct core interpretation: a steep hemolysis-versus-dose curve is consistent with a cooperative, thresholded membrane-permeabilization or poration process rather than independent binding events; however, interpreting a Hill slope of ~3 as indicating an exact trimeric functional unit is overconfident, since the Hill coefficient reflects apparent cooperativity or reaction order and does not reliably map to stoichiometry in membrane-disruption assays; several additional specifics (e.g., carpet-model Hill values, detergent-like nH < 1, or named-peptide stoichiometries) are stated too assertively, though they do not undermine the main mechanism-level conclusion.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|GEN-PEP-01,1,The syntactic-validity idea (that a sequence uses a defined amino-acid alphabet and excludes invalid tokens such as stop symbols) is broadly correct, and the developability framing appropriately highlights filtering on formulation- and physical-stability–related properties (e.g., solubility, self-association or aggregation, and charge or pH effects); however, the answer includes several confident but questionable specifics (such as typical oral-peptid
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|GEN-SM-09,1,Correctly lists and defines three standard distribution-learning metrics (validity, uniqueness, novelty) used in common benchmarks for molecular generators; the QED description is broadly accurate as a 0–1 drug-likeness heuristic based on multiple physicochemical and structural descriptors, but it functions more as a molecule-level property summary than a core generator-quality metric; the very specific “typical ranges” and named benchmark values or citations appear unreliable or unsubstantiated and should be pe
kimi-k2.5:cloud|SAR-SM-02,2,Correct direction and main rationale: esterification neutralizes the carboxylate and removes the Lys–carboxylate ion pair or salt bridge that often contributes several kcal/mol in favorable contexts, so potency typically drops markedly when that interaction is required; however, the quantitative claims (e.g., a ~5–10 kcal/mol penalty or blanket 100–1000× loss or complete inactivity) are overconfident, as salt-bridge energetics are highly environment-dependent; additionally, steric clash is a weak or speculative explanation here since a methyl group is small, and the potency loss is better attributed to loss of electrostatics and altered hydrogen bonding or desolvation.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|GEN-PEP-06,1,DNA shuffling and error-prone PCR are directed-evolution or library-construction methods rather than generation-time decoding or inference techniques for a peptide generator (e.g., temperature, top-k or top-p sampling), so the answer largely misses the question’s intent; the quantitative mutation-rate arithmetic is incorrect, since a 0.1–1% per-base rate would not produce 1–10 mutations on average for a 10-residue (~30-base) peptide; Shannon entropy is a reasonable quantitative metric for sequence diversity (position-wise or averaged), and the intuition that more uniform distributions yield higher entropy is correct.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|OPT-PEP-03,2,Names two standard stringency knobs—lowering antigen concentration and harsher or longer washing or competitive chase steps—that are widely used in phage panning and affinity maturation; correctly explains the expected pool shifts, with limiting antigen biasing toward higher apparent-affinity or competition winners and off-rate selection biasing toward slower dissociation (lower koff); the only caveat is a slightly overconfident implication that off-rate selection is the most effective route to picomolar affinity without noting common confounders such as avidity or valency effects, display level, and nonspecific stickiness, but t
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ASSAY-SM-02,2,Correctly identifies negative cooperativity as one plausible mechanistic cause of nH < 1 in binding or response relationships and correctly notes that shallow Hill slopes can arise from heterogeneity or mixtures (e.g., multiple nonidentical binding sites, subtypes, or targets) that produce composite curves with nH < 1; however, it is not expert-level because it omits other common assay-relevant explanations in small-molecule contexts, such as mixed target populations or active complexes and mechanism-linked shallow inhibition that does not reflect true cooperat
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|OPT-PEP-08,3,Correct core rationale: combinatorial explosion makes libraries intractable beyond a few diversified sites because sequence space grows as 20^n, so limiting mutated positions keeps libraries within screenable diversity and improves effective coverage of the intended design space; the linkage to epistasis is also correct, as introducing many simultaneous mutations increases nonadditive interactions, making combinations of otherwise good single mutants unpredictable and enriching nonfunctional or unstable variants, which favors iterative or local searches over large jumps; minor caveats are that specific display-capacity numbers are system- and implementation-dependent (e.g., practical phage, yeast, and ribosome-display limits vary) and that “full coverage” is idealized because codon usage and assembly
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|ASSAY-PEP-04,3,Half-life computation is correct: t1/2 = ln(2)/k ≈ 30.1 min, and after 120 min about 6.3% remains (~93.7% degraded), corresponding to roughly four half-lives; the interpretation for a 2-hour incubation is scientifically sound in that most peptide will be lost and endpoint readouts will be dominated
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ADMET-PEP-01,2,The stated typical peptide half-life range (≈2–30 min) and main clearance drivers (proteolysis and renal filtration) are consistent with standard peptide PK behavior; the three extension strategies are broadly appropriate, as Fc or HSA carrier approaches can yield day-to-week exposure (e.g., HSA ~19 days) and protease-resistance edits such as D–amino acid substitution often shift stability from minutes to hours; however, the PEGylation example using pegfilgrastim versus filgrastim is mismatched, since these are large G-CSF protein drugs rather than unmodified linear therapeutic peptides, making the example directionally rele
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|OPT-PEP-02,2,Correctly defines the Pareto-optimal (non-dominated) set as candidates for which no other option is at least as good in all objectives and strictly better in at least one, and correctly applies domination inequalities with mixed objective directions (e.g., maximize potency or stability while minimizing hemolysis) including the requirement of at least one strict improvement; it lacks a small but useful nuance in that potency is often reported as IC50 or EC50 where lower values are better, requiring an explicit monotone transform to align objective directions, so it falls just short of expert-level completeness.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ADMET-SM-09,2,Correct core experimental discriminators are identified, including IC50 shifts with NADPH-dependent preincubation and follow-up kinact/KI characterization, which are standard approaches for detecting time-dependent or mechanism-based inactivation; the clinical rationale is also correct in that such inactivation can persist because enzyme activity recovery depends on de novo CYP synthesis, allowing drug–drug interaction effects to outlast inhibitor exposure; however, confidence is reduced by overstatements such as implying no inhibition without NADPH (many MBIs have mixed reversible and time-dependent components) and by presenting several quantitative generalizations or labeling implications too broadly.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|SAR-SM-05,2,Correct qualitative SAR: replacing a secondary amide with an ester removes a hydrogen-bond donor and should significantly reduce potency when that donor interaction is truly critical; the parallel property effect is also correct in that amide-to-ester swaps commonly increase lipophilicity and often permeability, with matched-pair analyses reporting an average ALogP increase of ~0.6; however, the qua
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ADMET-SM-02,1,Correct general tactic: benzylic fluorination can attenuate CYP-mediated benzylic oxidation at metabolic soft spots; however, the mechanistic explanation contains important overclaims, since –CH₂–→–CHF– still leaves an abstractable hydrogen and the relevant step in benzylic hydroxylation is C–H abstraction rather than C–F bond cleavage, so the idea that fluorination “completely blocks the radical mechanism” is too strong; additionally, the quantitative claims (e.g., 5–50× reductions in CLint) and specific drug examples appear unsupported or unreliable and should be treated with caution.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|OPT-SM-02,2,Correctly describes Derringer–Suich desirability by mapping each objective to di ∈ [0,1] and aggregating via a (weighted) geometric mean (e.g., D = (∏ di^wi)^(1/∑wi), equivalently ∏ di^wi with normalized weights), and correctly notes the key limitation under conflict that the multiplicative form is zero-absorbing and strongly penalizes any single very poor property; however, some statements are overstated, as weighted scalarization does not make trade-offs impossible or literally collapse the Pareto frontier to a single point—rather, a fixed weight set yields one preferred compromise, and varying weights can recover different
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|ASSAY-SM-05,2,Correctly interprets the preincubation-dependent IC50 decrease as time-dependent inhibition consistent with slow-onset or slow-tight binding and/or covalent chemistry; jump-dilution or washout recovery is an appropriate follow-up to test reversibility, with recovery supporting slow-tight binding and little or no recovery supporting irreversible covalent inhibition; the only minor imprecision is that “TDI” is often reserved for CYP or NADPH-dependent inactivation contexts, though the underlying concept of time-dependent potency increase is correctly applied here.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|GEN-SM-04,2,Accurately defines reaction-aware generation as constructing molecules through sequences of known reactions and building blocks and correctly explains why this increases the fraction of proposals with an implicit feasible route compared with unconstrained SMILES sampling; how
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|ADMET-SM-06,2,Names two valid and commonly used strategies—polar-group masking via prodrugs and structural changes to reduce P-gp–mediated net efflux
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|GEN-SM-06,1,High-temperature sampling is a valid generation-time knob that typically increases stochasticity and diversity in sampled outputs; “diversity-promoting loss functions” are primarily training-time techniques and therefore do not satisfy the requirement for a second generation-time method (e.g., top-k/top-p sampling or stochastic diffusion settings); average pairwise Tanimoto similarity (or its complement as a distance) is a commonly used quantitative metric for internal diversity in molecular sets.
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ADMET-PEP-03,2,Identifies core immunogenicity drivers such as T-cell epitopes, aggregation, and chemical or processing modifications, along with valid mitigation strategies like epitope deimmunization and PEGylation that are commonly discussed for peptide and protein therapeutics; however, the “>1% soluble aggregates” threshold is over-specific and potentially misleading because the aggregation–immunogenicity relationship is highly context-dependent, and the answer omits practical expert-level caveats (e.g., HLA and patient g
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|GEN-PEP-03,2,Correct rationale: fixing a known motif or hotspot reduces the effective search space and anchors key binding interactions, often improving the likelihood of finding binders compared with a fully de novo search; the developability constraint is also appropriate, as limiting hydrophobicity or aggregation propensity—often paired with enforcing a non-neutral net charge to reduce self-association—is a common practical filter and net charge is a known modulator of peptide aggregation behavior; minor issues are some overconfident wording (e.g., implying guaranteed en
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|ASSAY-PEP-09,2,The kinetic explanation invoking two peptide subpopulations with different cleavability and slow interconversion (e.g., proline cis/trans or conformational gating) is scientifically plausible for a fast initial drop followed by a slow phase; the “fresh substrate spike” is a valid experiment to distinguish enzyme inactivation or product inhibition from substrate-linked heterogeneity by testing whether the fast phase reappears, but it is not fully diagnostic of the specific conformational-equilibrium mechanism and mainly assesses enzyme competence, so it falls short of expert-level mechanistic validation.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|ADMET-SM-04,3,Half-life calculation is correct using t1/2 = 0.693·Vd/CL, giving 0.693 × 300 / 30 ≈ 6.9 h; the interpretation of a very large Vd is also correct, as an apparent volume far exceeding total body water (~42 L in a 70 kg adult) implies extensive tissue distribution or sequestration with a low plasma fraction; the mechanistic examples cited, such as high lipophilicity, tissue protein or phospholipid binding, and low plasma concentrations relative to total body amount, are appropriate and contain no major errors.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|OPT-PEP-02,2,Correctly defines the Pareto-optimal (non-dominated) set and the intuition that one objective cannot be improved without worsening another, and applies the correct dominance criterion of being at least as good in all objectives and strictly better in at least one (with hemolysis treated as a minimization objective); minor issues include briefly muddled potency directionality (IC50 or EC50 should be minimized, not maximized) and an overstrong claim that dominated candidates are “irrelevant,” which ignores noise, constraints, and secondary considerations that ca
kimi-k2.5:cloud|GEN-PEP-10,3,Correctly identifies the core representation updates required for noncanonical amino acids, including residue or topology templates, stereochemistry, atom typing with partial charges, and bonded and torsional parameters, along with vocabulary or feature expansion for ML models; correctly notes downstream scoring updates such as ensuring energy-function compatibility with new atom types and charges, appropriate solvation and protonation handling, and geometry, strain, or valence sanity checks, consistent with standard ncAA parameterization practices that use RESP or QM charge derivation and torsion fitting against QM potential-energy scans; a few items are more conditional than mandatory (e.g., metal centers or excited-state photochemistry), but they do not introduce
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|GEN-SM-05,2,Correctly notes that optimizing a QSAR or regressor via guidance often leads to reward hacking through exploitation of predictor errors, frequently via out-of-distribution structures or spurious motifs; the proposed practical detection method is valid, using an independent control model or ensemble and flagging large score disagreements as a classic optimization-versus-control check; however, some specifics are over
kimi-k2.5:cloud|OPT-SM-04,3,Correctly explains that EI favors candidates with high predicted mean relative to the current best and/or high predictive uncertainty that could plausibly yield improvement, and provides the standard closed-form EI expression for a Gaussian predictive distribution; it also correctly motivates the need for uncertainty to distinguish “unknown” from “bad” and to enable a principled exploration–exploitation trade-off rather than greedy mean maximization; minor overstatements or omissions include treating uncertainty as synonymous with distance from training data (which is UQ- and model-dependent), imprecise use of “value of perfect information,” and not addressing noisy-EI or incumbent-definition subtleties.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|ASSAY-SM-01,3,Correctly defines IC50 as an operational potency metric measured under specific assay conditions and distinguishes it from intrinsic affinity (Ki); correctly identifies substrate concentration as a key determinant for competitive inhibitors and provides the Cheng–Prusoff relationship IC50 = Ki(1 + [S]/Km); the practical directionality is correct, with higher substrate concentrat
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|GEN-SM-07,2,Correctly lists Lipinski’s Rule of Five with standard cutoffs (MW < 500, cLogP < 5, HBD ≤ 5, HBA ≤ 10); the SA score description and 1–10 scaling (lower scores indicating easier synthesis) are correct, with the caveat that a “<6” cutoff is a common heuristic rather than a universal standard; using PAINS as a structural-alert (binary) filter is appropriate, making the an
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|GEN-PEP-03,2,Correctly explains that fixing a core epitope can raise hit rates by anchoring key contact geometry and reducing the combinatorial search space, and correctly notes that avoiding or limiting cysteine is a common developability or library constraint due to oxidation and disulfide-related manufacturing complications; the minor limitation is that developability constraints are typically multifactorial (e.g., solubility, aggregation, hydrophobicity, charge), so presenting cysteine avoidance as the primary rule is somewhat narrow.
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|OPT-PEP-10,2,Correct: none of the four peptides is dominated, since no other peptide improves EC50, half-life, and HC50 simultaneously, so all are Pareto-optimal; the reasoning applies the correct domination condition across pairwise comparisons and, while slightly verbose or redundant, contains no scientific or decision-logic errors.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|SAR-PEP-04,2,Core conclusion is correct: D-amino acid substitution at a buried helical interface position would severely disrupt binding and likely cause major activity loss, with sound mechanistic reasoning based on helix disruption; however, the geometric explanation is oversimplified, since L→D substitution inverts backbone φ/ψ dihedrals rather than producing a simple ~180° side-chain flip, and the confident quantitative claims (>100×–1000× losses, specific IC50 shifts, and disruption spanning 2–4 neighboring residues) are
kimi-k2.5:cloud|OPT-PEP-04,2,Core idea is correct and practically relevant: map sequences into a continuous embedding or latent space, fit a Gaussian process surrogate, and use expected improvement to balance high predicted mean against high uncertainty when proposing new candidates; however, there are overstatements and shaky specifics, since Bayesian optimization can be applied directly to discrete sequences via string-kernel approaches, and terms like “weighted degree kernel with SMOTEO” or “retractile BO” appear non-standard or incorrectly named; additionally, some peptide-specific examples are questionable (e.g., handling D-amino acids or ncAAs in typical protein-LM embe
