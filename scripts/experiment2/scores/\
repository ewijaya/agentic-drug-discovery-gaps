qwen3-next:80b-cloud|GEN-SM-05,0,The provided answer is truncated/incomplete and does not state a failure mode or a detection method.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|SAR-PEP-08,2,Fold-change math is correct: \u0394\u0394G \u2248 1.0 kcal/mol at 298 K corresponds to ~5.4× affinity improvement.
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|SAR-PEP-08,3,Correct mechanism-level explanation: stapling increases helical preorganization and lowers the conformational entropy penalty upon binding from a mostly disordered state.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|GEN-PEP-10,1,Captures some core needs (expanded residue/topology definitions; force-field/charge/dihedral/rotamer/solvation parameterization for nnAAs) but mixes in many confident, likely-hallucinated numeric specifics and exaggerated error claims.
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|GEN-PEP-05,2,Correctly identifies “model hacking”/artifact exploitation as the key failure mode for generator optimization against a fixed predictor
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|OPT-PEP-01,1,Definition is essentially correct: single-position Ala substitutions to map SAR/hotspots.Overstates interpretation: big loss can reflect direct target contacts or indirect structural/solubility/stability effects; answer frames it mostly as direct interactions.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|GEN-SM-02,2,Correct core explanation: graph generation can enforce/localize chemical constraints (valence/bonding) during decoding, while naive character-level SMILES must learn brittle syntax and long-range dependencies (rings/branches), causing many invalid strings.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ADMET-PEP-07,2,Correct computation of extraction ratio,Overconfident mechanistic add-ons.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ASSAY-SM-05,2,Correctly interprets the IC50 left-shift with longer preincubation as time-dependent inhibition, consistent with slow-tight binding and/or covalent inhibition.Appropriate follow-up: a (jump-)dilution / activity-recovery assay to test reversibility (persistent inhibition after large dilution supports irreversible/covalent; recovery supports reversible/slow-tight).Minor limitations: recovery thresholds like “>80%” are arbitrary, and slow off-rate inhibitors can look “irreversible” over short observation windows unless you monitor recovery over time (or add orthogonal confirmation such as dialysis/washout or adduct MS).
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ASSAY-PEP-10,2,Interpretation is correct under common HTS convention: Z′ between 0.5 and 1.0 is considered excellent assay separation/quality.  Minor nuance missing: “>0.5” is a widely used rule-of-thumb rather than a universal gate, but this doesn’t make the answer wrong.
kimi-k2.5:cloud|OPT-PEP-09,2,Correct multiplicative prediction. The added binding-energy estimate is wrong.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|OPT-SM-09,1,Correctly computes the multiplicative prediction. Answer is truncated/incomplete, so overall only partially answers the question.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ASSAY-PEP-04,3,Half-life calculation is correct. Correct, relevant caveat about pseudo-first-order conditions and what that implies about the kinetic assumption.
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ASSAY-PEP-06,2,TI calculation is correct. Design direction is reasonable (tuning membrane selectivity via reduced hydrophobicity / altered cationicity), though a bit oversimplified without noting trade-offs or amphipathicity/hydrophobic moment nuance.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|SAR-PEP-01,1,Directionally plausible that Leu→Phe could improve affinity by enabling an edge-to-face aryl–aryl contact if the pocket tolerates the larger aromatic and the geometry is realized, but “most likely” is still too strong given missing structural/solvation constraints.The quantitative affinity claim (5–50×) and specific kcal/mol attributions are overconfident/unsupported; even the canonical edge-to-face benzene dimer interaction energy (~2.31 kcal/mol in high-level calculations) does not directly map to net protein–ligand ΔΔG in water.The ΔG↔Kd conversion intuition is fine (a 10× affinity change corresponds to ~1.4 kcal/mol at 25 °C), but the answer extrapolates this into a specific fold-change without enough evidence.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|SAR-PEP-05,2,Correct core expectation, Reasonable secondary benefit. Overconfident specifics: the “steric clash at 2.9 Å” and “10–1000×” potency loss are highly context/geometry-dependent (and the 2.9 Å figure is usually an H-bond metric, not a guaranteed methyl–protein clash distance)
deepseek-v3.2:cloud|ADMET-SM-05,2,Correct use of the well-stirred model form and the “high extraction” limit, Minor caveat missing: if reducing fᵤ makes fᵤ·CL_int no longer ≫ Q_h, clearance would start decreasing proportionally; the answer assumes the high-extraction condition still holds after the change.
qwen3-next:80b-cloud|ASSAY-SM-04,2,Correct use of Cheng–Prusoff for a competitive inhibitor. Minor nuance not addressed: Cheng–Prusoff relies onstandard assumptions (simple reversible competition.
gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud|ASSAY-SM-07,2, Lacks some practical specificity/nuance (e.g., confirmatory repeat assays; pH–solubility/pKa/logD profiling to choose between salt vs structural fixes), and the response is truncated mid-action.
