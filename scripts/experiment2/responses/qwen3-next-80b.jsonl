Fluorine also provides steric shielding.  \n   - **Impact**: α-Fluorinated tertiary amines (e.g., fluoxetine analogs) show 3- to 10-fold lower clearance. pKa may increase slightly (e.g., +0.2–0.5 units for –CH₂F vs. –CH₃) due to the electron-withdrawing effect, but the amine remains sufficiently basic for most targets.\n\n**Key rationale**: Both strategies directly block the rate-limiting step in N-dealkylation (C–H bond", "latency_ms": 6330, "timestamp": "2026-02-09T13:17:41.942660+00:00", "success": true, "error": null}

This reduces renal clearance by preventing passage through kidney glomeruli.  \n   - *Example*: PEGylated exenatide (Bydureon®) has a half-life of ~1 week vs. 2.4 hours for native exenatide, primarily due to reduced renal clearance.\n\n2. **Albumin Binding (e.g., fatty acid conjugation or albumin-binding domains)**  \n   - **Addresses proteolysis primarily**.  \n   - Binding to endogenous serum albumin (half-life ~19 days in humans) shields the peptide from proteolytic enzymes and leverages albumin's FcRn-mediated recycling pathway. This minimizes enzymatic degradation in plasma/tissues.  \n   - *Example*: Liraglutide (Victoza®) uses a C16 fatty acid chain for albumin binding, extending half-life to ~13 hours vs. minutes for native GLP-1, mainly by reducing proteolysis.\n\n**Key Clarification**: While PEGylation may offer minor protease protection, its dominant effect is on renal clearance.
